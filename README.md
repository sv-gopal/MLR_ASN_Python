Multiple Regression for Airfoil Self Noice Dataset using Python 


The data set information is given below:

Data Set Information:

The NASA data set comprises different size NACA 0012 airfoils at various wind tunnel speeds and angles of attack. The span of the airfoil and the observer position were the 
same in all of the experiments.

Attribute Information:

This problem has the following inputs:

Frequency, in Hertzs.
Angle of attack, in degrees.
Chord length, in meters.
Free-stream velocity, in meters per second.
Suction side displacement thickness, in meters.
The only output is: 6. Scaled sound pressure level, in decibels.

The primary objective of the project is to establish a relation between Scaled sound pressure level as a dependent variable and other variables as independent 
variables using Statmodel API for Python. Attempts have been made to check for the model assumptions such as Normality, Heteroscadasticity, Multicollinearity and also identification of leverage points.
